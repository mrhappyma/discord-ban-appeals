# Discord Ban Appeals

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/47631f5e-7ffe-4aca-a60a-b2d9f9a38b05/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/userexes-basement-appeals/deploys)

Fork of [sylevon/discord-ban-appeals](https://github.com/sylveon/discord-ban-appeals) but it doesn't show up like that for some reason

Powers the ban appeals system with Basement Manager #7107 (if you couldn't figure that out)
